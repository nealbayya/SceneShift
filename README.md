# SceneShift
Goal: Make a web interface where people can upload a photo of themselves and choose from a variety of different scenes on the website to "shift" to. Image Matting and Composting will be used to build a model for the person's body and copy-paste it to a new scene. This will entail the user coarsly highlighting the pixels corresponding to the person using an Etch-A-Sketch sort of tool.

I expect the first iteration to be released by August (as I still have to learn some backend webdev and review image matting).
